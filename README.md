**Introduction of the Work**：
1. I selected audio to drive my code.

2. The swimming ring in the image will rotate with the music, and the decorative dots on the swimming ring will also rotate. In our group's works, KK and I focused on the animation of the main object, while others focused on the animation of the background. KK's swimming ring is scaled, while my swimming ring is rotated and moved. Our group's works each ensured differences.

3. Animation inspiration：When I saw this picture, I thought of the scene of listening to music in the summer and watching the swimming rings floating in the swimming pool. This gave me the inspiration for the code.
